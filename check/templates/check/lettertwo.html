Please make your payment in cash, certified check, cashier’s check or money order only. It is imperative that you do so without delay. If funds are now available in your account and you would like me to redeposit the check, please let me know as soon as possible. You may contact me at [Your Phone Number]. If you have already sent replacement funds, please disregard this letter. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
